		<p>
			Hello!
			<br>
			This is a small disclaimer about my assignment.
			<br>
			I prefer using <span style="font-weight:bold;">English</span> as compared to Hebrew for various reasons.
			<br>
			Mainly, it's simply easier for me to format and design the document when everything is in the same language.
			<br>
			This shouldn't, and wouldn't affect my ability to make the same exact document in hebrew.
			<br>
			Rather, it will simply slow me down and reduce my efficiency, if I had chosen to write this in Hebrew.
			<br>
			<br>
			In addition to all of the above, I used <span style="font-weight:bold;">Internet Explorer 11</span> (for
			Windows 10) to create and test this document.
			<br>
			This could lead to incompatibilities with other browsers, and thus, I would like to apologize for any
			inconvenience.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48)">Hardest Part During the Project</h2>
		<p>
			As a matter of fact, it wasn't hard at all.
			<br>
			Practice makes perfect, and I had a whole lot of practice.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48)">Most Enjoyable Part During the Project</h2>
		<p>
			Literally all of it was so much fun to make, simply because it was so straightforward.
			<br>
			Specifically JavaScript is a lot of fun as compared to HTML/CSS.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48)">Why Do I Think That This (Work-)Domain Is for Me?</h2>
		<p>
			Going off with the assumption that it wasn't clear so far...
			<br>
			I really enjoy programming, scripting, designing and the like!
			<br>
			I enjoy seeing my little creations flourish and come to life!
			<br>
			I also have the motivation to learn and the persistence and whatever else might be needed to keep it up even
			when it's hard.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48)">A Summary of the Course's Trial-Run</h2>
		<p>
			I really enjoyed it, not only because it was exactly what I love doing, but also because I learnt a lot of
			new things.
			<br>
			Yes, even though I code a whole bunch, I never really touched any web related coding, so this was fresh!
			<br>
			Honestly, I'm glad that I took this course, and I'm hoping to continue it right to the end and fulfil my
			dream as a .NET software engineer.
